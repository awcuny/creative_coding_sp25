# Week 06: Data Visualization

We are meeting over Slack this week.

### Lecture
This week, we'll delve into the realm of visualizing data sets using p5js and explore why coding surpasses Illustrator in this domain. Our discussions will span from discovering and gathering data to the crucial steps of data cleaning and analysis, all while considering the ethical implications of data visualization. We'll examine exemplary instances of data visualizations and dissect common pitfalls that designers encounter in this field. Furthermore, we'll explore innovative projects that utilize sound, touch, and even taste to convey data insights. Lastly, we'll draw inspiration from artists who employ data as a primary medium in their creative endeavors.

### In Class
1. We will review the p5 font homework you did last week - be ready to share!
2. We will talk about your midterms and what is expected of you.

### Homework / Midterm Assignment

1. **Design a poster using p5.js** for your midterm due on week 7. You may choose to design a poster for **one of the following topics**:
    - A movie, short film, or TV series.
    - A book cover or advertising for a book.
    - An event such as a concert, festival, conference, or a performance.
    - A poster raising awareness about social issues, environmental causes, or community initiatives.
    - A poster for a sport event, team, or athlete.
    - A travel destination poster or showcasing a scenic location.
    - An informational educational poster, health and safety notices, or a public announcement.
   
2. You must follow every instruction listed or else we will deduct points.
    - Do not create an interactive poster yet. This is a design challenge, and I am looking to see what you can do with just the forms, shapes, and colors of your poster with code. No mouse interactions or keyboard interactions yet, please.
    - Do not create an animated poster. It must be still.
    - You must incorporate creating a class, using functions, and as many programming techniques covered so far this semester.
   
3. Other than that, you have the creative freedom to design anything you wish. Enjoy the process and let your creativity shine!
4. Be prepared to share your designs and code with the class during our next class - we will be meeting over Zoom.
