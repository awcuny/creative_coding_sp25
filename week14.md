# Week 14: Finals

We are meeting on Zoom this week.

### Lecture
This week, you will submit your final projects on the Slack channel.

### Final Project ###

1. **Design an interactive project using p5.js for your final** due on May 14, 2024. You may choose to design an interactive sketch for one of the following topics:
- An interactive art generator.
- A choose your own adventure story
- A simple game
- Animated data visualizations using charts and graphs
- A music visualizer
- An interactive map
- A virtual musical instrument
- A filter for images

2. You must follow every instruction listed or else we will deduct points.
- This is more a design challenge than a coding challenge. I am looking to see what you can do with the forms, shapes, and colors of your projects as well as how you allow interaction with them. I am less interested in how your code works and will be happy to help you optimize it.
- Please use as many programming techniques covered so far this semester. Including for loops, logic checks, classes and using libraries such as dat.GUI or p5 sound.

3. Other than that, you have the creative freedom to design anything you wish. Enjoy the process and let your creativity shine!
4. Be prepared to share your designs and code with the class. You can present as a video or as a long written post on Slack.
