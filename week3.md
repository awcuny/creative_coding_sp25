# Week 03: Computational Color and Export

We are meeting over Slack this week.

### Lecture
This week, we will be talking about color theory for the visual arts. How colors interact with each other and traditional color schemes that have been proven to work well. What moods different colors represent. And of course how to create all of these colors using p5js. We will also be covering how to export a image and a SVG from p5js.

By the end of the week, please cover these color coding examples and functions:

### Coding Examples

### In Class
1. We will review the posters you designed for this week as homework and give each other feedback.
2. Duplicate your sketch and add color to your posters. Play around with different color schemes.
3. Share your new creation to the class.

### In Class Coding Examples
1. [A spiral](https://editor.p5js.org/awcuny/sketches/-6q_V2Sx0) using the Archimedean spiral formula
2. A sketch that shows [a grid and where your mouse is](https://editor.p5js.org/awcuny/sketches/FHjleoh7Q)
3. This is an example of how to code [a gradient for a background](https://editor.p5js.org/awcuny/sketches/dc_qJe6V3)
4. Based on Sunbul's homework, how to [write your own function](https://editor.p5js.org/awcuny/sketches/NzW1pKmhP).
5. A more in depth exploration of [the rotate function](https://editor.p5js.org/awcuny/sketches/M2AGCDX0a).

### Homework
1. Read the chapter on color on [www.programmingdesignsystems.com](https://www.programmingdesignsystems.com/color/a-short-history-of-color-theory/index.html#a-short-history-of-color-theory-xZzRFOZ)
2. Suggested Reading: Pages 85 – 93 in Processing, by Casey Reas and Ben Fry.
3. Use p5js to design a poster that represents who you are. Pick your favorite color as a base color and play with the color schemes we went over today or use an analogous color scheme based on the month your birthday is in. This can be realistic or abstract, as long as you can explain your reasons behind the poster.
4. Be prepared to share your poster designs with the class on Slack next week.
5. Watch the lecture video for [Week 4](https://youtu.be/DLRXAg9f_Lk?si=000SVEXl1MRNHJI5) and come to class with questions.
