# Week 13: Computer Vision

We are meeting over Slack this week.

### Lecture
This week, we're diving into how computers perceive the world. We'll start by exploring the early stages of computer vision, using techniques like web cameras and background subtraction. We'll also cover topics such as fiducial markers, augmented reality, facial detection, and navigating in 3D space. After that, we'll show you how to implement these concepts using Processing. While Processing itself is powerful, there are even more advanced features available in libraries like [OpenCV](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing), [Kinect](https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/), [Leap Motion](https://github.com/voidplus/leap-motion-processing), [QR Codes](http://makezine.com/2011/03/02/codebox-use-qr-codes-in-processing/), and Facial Detection ([FaceOSC](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/FaceOSC-Templates)). Keep in mind that some of these advanced features are specific to the Java version of Processing, but there's still plenty of exciting things we can do with p5.js.

### In Class
1. We will review the homework you did - Final project ideas
2. You will read through the [p5 sound library documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) to try out audio and p5js.
3. Review the lecture pdf and video above.

### Homework 

Finish up your final project and be prepared to present it in Slack class next week!

### Final Project ###

1. **Design an interactive project using p5.js for your final** due on week 14, May 7, 2024. You may choose to design an interactive sketch for one of the following topics:
- An interactive art generator.
- A choose your own adventure story
- A simple game
- Animated data visualizations using charts and graphs
- A music visualizer
- An interactive map
- A virtual musical instrument
- A filter for images

2. You must follow every instruction listed or else we will deduct points.
- This is more a design challenge than a coding challenge. I am looking to see what you can do with the forms, shapes, and colors of your projects as well as how you allow interaction with them. I am less interested in how your code works and will be happy to help you optimize it.
- Please use as many programming techniques covered so far this semester. Including for loops, logic checks, classes and using libraries such as dat.GUI or p5 sound.

3. Other than that, you have the creative freedom to design anything you wish. Enjoy the process and let your creativity shine!
4. Be prepared to share your designs and code with the class during our next class - we will be meeting over Zoom.
